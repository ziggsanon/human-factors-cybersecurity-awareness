# Human Factors in Cybersecurity Awareness Project

This project highlights my contributions to a two-week security awareness sprint focused on human factor threats and training using the Wizer platform. It demonstrates the critical role of human behavior in cybersecurity, the challenges of employee engagement, and the importance of accessible, inclusive security training.

## Objective
To research human factor threats, develop and deploy a security awareness training program tailored to the organization, simulate phishing attacks, and ensure inclusivity through accessibility testing.

## My Key Contributions

- **Security Awareness Program Design**: Created engaging, easy-to-understand training content for technical and non-technical employees.
- **Threat Research & Case Study**: Analyzed the 2024 Fortinet data breach and mapped lessons to our organizationâ€™s context.
- **Phishing Simulation**: Designed and deployed realistic phishing emails to gauge user awareness and responses.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensured training content was accessible to employees with visual and hearing impairments by including captions, clear layouts, and alternate formats.
- **Presentation & Reporting**: Delivered a final presentation to stakeholders, showcasing findings, employee engagement stats, and key recommendations.
- **Risk Behavior Mapping**: Studied psychological factors and behavioral risks that lead to breaches, developing tailored countermeasures.
- **Collaboration**: Worked cross-functionally with other interns to assign users to departments, monitor training progress, and improve completion rates.

## Key Lessons

- Human error remains a top cybersecurity risk â€” awareness training must be regular, simple, and inclusive.
- Accessibility in training is essential for compliance and inclusion.
- Behavioral monitoring, third-party risks, and phishing remain major human-factor vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used

- **Wizer** â€“ Training platform for video modules, phishing simulation, user tracking.
- **Lera & Pave PDF** â€“ Accessibility testing tools for documents and platforms.
- **Canva** â€“ Visual storytelling and presentation delivery.

## Recommendations

- Regular department-specific training and phishing exercises.
- Stronger access controls with SSO and MFA.
- Continuous monitoring of user behavior.
- Inclusive security design in all awareness campaigns.
